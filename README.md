‚úÖ Phase 1: Pod Cleanup Controller Using Shared Informer (No Kubebuilder)
Goal: Build a lightweight controller using client-go shared informer to delete "Failed" or "Evicted" pods after X minutes.

üîß Tools & Concepts You‚Äôll Learn
Go routines, channels, WaitGroup

SharedInformer (no Kubebuilder)

Kubernetes client-go

JSON logging

Graceful shutdown via context and signal.Notify

üîÅ Basic Flow
Start a shared informer to watch pods.

On pod ADD or UPDATE:

If status is Failed or Evicted, spawn a goroutine to wait N minutes then delete it.

Use a buffered channel to avoid memory overload.

Log actions in JSON format.
